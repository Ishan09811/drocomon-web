Drocomon is a fan-made, private and non-profit project created only to Recreate Pokemon let's go Pikachu using Godot game engine for Educational purpose only. This game is neither for everyone nor for sale. All the models, images, music, textures, etc are owned by their respective owners,i.e, not me. The original game, Pokemon let's go pikachu is created by Game Freak and Pokemon itself is owned by Nintendo and I don't own any part of the company, so I have just created this game for my Educational purpose and I'll not monetize this project in future as well. & If you find this game released on any platform except youtube and this website and you Paid for that then you just got scammed because this project will always be Free.
